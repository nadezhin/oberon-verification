oberon-verification
===================

Verification of Project Oberon with ACL2 prover.

Project Oberon is a book by Niklaus Wirth and JÃ¼rg Gutknecht:
http://www-oldurls.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/ProjectOberon/index.html .
It describes The Design of an Operating System, a Compiler, and a Computer.
The design is simple an elegant. It is a good motivating example to learn
Formal Verification - both hardware and software. We use Formal Verification
tool ACL2 from UT Austin: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/ .
We start from verification of simplified version RISC-0 of Oberon processor:
